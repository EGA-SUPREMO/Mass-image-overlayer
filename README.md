# Mass-image-overlayer
Merges two images one on top of another
In run.py you can change both directories where images are obtained, and in `getSmallerSizesOfCarsForTemplates` you can change those values to make different sizes, I forgot how they work but currently they are configured to make the template image smaller in relation to the car image, useful to add small texts and such
